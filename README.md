## A Step-by-Step Guide for Preparing and Submitting a Scientific Manuscript

### Motivation

Preparing and submitting a scientific manuscript to a journal can be complex and time-consuming, especially for early-career researchers. 

Ensuring all necessary materials are included and meet the guidelines of the target scientific journal is crucial for a successful submission. However, the volume of tasks can be overwhelming (e.g., manuscript, supplementary file, title pages, figures, tables).

[Pharmaco-Omics Lab](https://pharmomicslab.site/) has developed a comprehensive checklist to streamline the manuscript submission process. This checklist provides a step-by-step guide, outlining the essential components of a manuscript and providing practical tips for preparing each element. The document can be found at this [link](ManuscriptSubmissionGuide.pdf).

We anticipate that researchers can improve the overall quality of their submission package and increase the opportunity for acceptance.
